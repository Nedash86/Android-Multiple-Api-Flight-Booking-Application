Objectives:

The problem is that there is no quick way to spontaniously procure a flight to an unknown location for an adventurous vacation.

We learnt that there are people who would be interested in a roulette system but we are not making possible any of the goals defined in the research.md file.


The Customer:

The research finding found that the ideal customer should be someone who has minimal attatchments to their routines. This removes the following: families with small children, a sizable sum of couples, people who like to keep to their agendas, people over the age of 60, people who can't affor to travel.

The ideal customer is a savvy risktaker who has little stopping them from thaking the leap of faith. The audience is less about age and more about targeting those who seek adventures.


Features:

An activity with filters for your timeframe, number of people and budget

All three fields were requested by what the people mentioned in the research.md file and so were included as a feature to apply before the queries for the main product began

A second activity displays the result(s) in a card view with a picture and description, 
This was in response to making the UI clear. The information is neatly protrayed underneath the randomize button

along with flight options A checkout option to purchase the item. An option to re-run the randomizer for a new result
People complained that they may not like the result that is shown so the buttn should be able to run more than once, clearing and reincerting card view's data


Competative Analysis:

My competitors do not have apps that do this service or their entire infrastructure is currently broken. I am providing a free solution to purchasing tickets on the go. You can even share the information with friends before you purchase

Constraints:

Depending on the thoroughness of the APIs i havebeen looking at I may have to implement some from multiple airlines or just a couple more broad reaching APIs.
