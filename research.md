Title: Answers viewing application

Authors: Me

Date: 8/23/2016

Background:

Some people find that they want to be adventurous and go about travelling across the globe. What better than to have the computer choose for you.

Goals:

Learn if users really would like to have their travel destination choices out of their control 
Learn how they would want this experience to be developed.

Research Questions:

Do you think you are spontaneous enough to let a computer choose your travel destination?
Would you like to see a collection of chosen destinations from which to choose?
Do you think you would be comfortable doing this on an app?
Where do you currently go on holiday?
Have there been any proven practical implications?
Are there people spontaneous enough for this?

Methedology:

I will send out an online questionnaire to be completed by tomorrow afternoon. 
I will look online for implications of this idea

Participants:

I will be sending this to people from early 22 - 40 as they are the age group with the highest app usage in combination with downloads.

Schedule:

The study will take place today. The study will end tonight (late), results will be even later tonight.

Script: 

How much they value travel
•	Do you consider travel as a luxury or something you budget each year?
Their level of spontaneity.
•	Would you consider yourself spontaneous and if so why?
If they would feel more comfortable given the option of multiple airlines
•	Would you feel more comfortable given the option of multiple airlines or do you think it takes away the spontaneous aspect?
With whom do they travel
•	Do you travel alone?
Their price range in travel
•	What price range would you feel paying for an airline ticket?

As a user I want to put in the number of travel companions and departure destination and be taken to the roulette page
As a user I want to be able to click on the roulette button and see the resulting option(s) within the same page, potentially within a card view inside a fragment
As a user I want to be able to save results to the wish list cart
As a user I want to check the cheapest fares from the chosen destination and purchase with the airline (with caution while in development)

User Stories:

Bob Smith 25
•	Is on holiday and considering travelling abroad and considers himself to be a spontaneous human being. 
•	He has no children nor a spouse so is not tied down by any family matters and can afford to travel to a new destination.
•	Bob is an avid traveler and enjoys sports as a past time. You would not be surprised to see him hiking during the summer.
•	Being a global traveler as a child Bob has experiences travelling alone and it does not bother him, he actually is thrilled at the possibility of encountering new cultures first hand.
•	Bob does have a limited budget to work with so he would like to have an option of price ranges as he can’t afford $2000 or $3000 tickets.
